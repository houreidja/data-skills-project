<p>Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, people stayed home, but continued to eat. The use of food delivery apps surged while we were in quarantine, and continue to rise. Their popularity makes sense; they are convenient. However, while they serve as way for people to receive their food from the safety of their homes, they also raise a number of issues related to the exploitation of workers. </p>

<h3>There are three main companies which dominate the field, which elimiates all competition. This makes it hard to negotiate.</h3>

<p>  As of September 2021, DoorDash, UberEats and Grubhub dominated the delivery app market. DoorDash and Grubhub own multiple apps, which makes competition difficult, because, that when consumers order from the subsidiaries, the money still ultimately goes to these companies. DoorDash, UberEats and Grubhub comprised 96% of food delivery orders last month, with DoorDash alone taking up 57%. With three main companies taking the lion's share of orders, it is difficult for delivery drivers to find other companies that will be as competitive.</p>

<h3>Drivers are often at risk of having their bikes stolen and are vulnerable to violence.</h3>

<p> According a survey of 500 drivers conducted by the Workers' Justice Project and Cornell University, 54% of workers have had their bikes stolen. These bikes are incredibly expensive to replace, costing at between $1,000-2,000. Earlier this month a Bangladeshi delivery worker for Grubhub was  murdered in Brooklyn and his bike was stolen. In April, a DoorDash driver from Mexico was killed in Manhattan and his bike was stolen as well. </p>

<h3>Delivery drivers get paid very little compared to the profit the apps make.</h3>

<p> The aforementioned survey found that, when tips (which fluctuate wildly) were factored in, drivers earned an hourly average of $12.12, which is less than New York State's minumum wage of $15. Without tips, delivery worker make a net average of only $7.87, which is just over half of New York State's miminum wage. Apps can get away with this because delivery workers are hired as independent contractors.</p>

<h3>In late September, City Council voted to pass a series of bills aimed to improve the working conditions of food delivery workers. </h3>

<p>Restaurants will now be required to allow delivery drivers to access the restroom or face fines. The bills also address issues such as minimum wage and travel distance for the workers, with the goal of better treatment for the workers. These are small, but overdue, rights that will be given to delivery workers, who are often immigrants. Los Deliveristas Unidos, an advocacy group comprised of delivery workers, helped spark the bills.</p>
